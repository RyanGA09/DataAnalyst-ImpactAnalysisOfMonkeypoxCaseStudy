# Monkeypox Analysis Project

A comprehensive data analysis project focusing on the Monkeypox outbreak. This Jupyter notebook provides insights and visualizations to understand the spread, trends, and impacts of the Monkeypox virus globally. By leveraging data science techniques, this project aims to facilitate deeper understanding and provide informative results regarding the outbreak.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and transforming raw data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Overview and statistical description of Monkeypox cases by country and region.
- **Data Visualization**: Time-series plots, histograms, and bar charts to visualize trends and distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive analysis using regression models and other techniques.
- **Insights & Conclusions**: Summary of findings and recommendations for further research.

## Technologies Used

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/SimpleDesignUploadCRUD.git
   ```

   (Replace username with your GitHub username)

2. Create a Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   ```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

   - On Window:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

   ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate

   ```

4. Install Required Packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb

   ```

6. Run the Cells: Execute each cell sequentially in the notebook to perform data analysis and visualize results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is included in the `data/` directory (if available) or can be downloaded from [Monkeypox Data Source](https://ourworldindata.org/mpox). Ensure the data file is placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests, or make changes directly in the repository for improvements or bug fixes. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the existing style and coding standards.

Important: When contributing, please create a new branch for your changes instead of pushing directly to the main branch. To do this:

1. With Forking:

   1. Fork Repository
      On the project page you want to contribute to, click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
   2. Clone Forked Repository
      After forking, open your terminal and run the following command to clone the forked repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/SimpleDesignUploadCRUD.git
      ```

   3. Navigate to the Project Directory
      Change to the project directory with the command:

      ```bash
      cd SimpleDesignUploadCRUD
      ```

   4. Create a new branch
      Create a new branch for the feature or bug fix you want to add:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b your-feature-branch
      ```

   5. Make your changes and commit them
      Make the necessary changes in the code. After that, add the changes to the staging area and commit:

      ```bash
      git add .
      ```

      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add a descriptive message about your changes"
      ```

   6. Push the branch to your forked repository
      After committing, push the new branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

      ```bash
      git push -u origin your-feature-branch
      ```

   7. Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.

   - Go to the original repository (the one you forked) on GitHub.
   - Click the "Pull Requests" tab and then click "New Pull Request".
   - Select your branch from your fork as the source (base) and the main branch from the original repository as the target (compare).
   - Provide a suitable description and submit the pull request.

2. Without Forking

   1. Create a new branch
      Create a new branch for the feature or bug fix you want to add:

      ```bash
      git checkout -b your-feature-branch
      ```

   2. Make your changes and commit them
      Make the necessary changes in the code. After that, add the changes to the staging area and commit:

      ```bash
      git add .
      ```

      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add a descriptive message about your changes"
      ```

   3. Push the branch to your branch at the repository
      Push the new branch to the repository:

      ```bash
      git push -u origin your-feature-branch
      ```

   <!-- 4. Merge changes back to the main branch:
      If you have write access to the main repository, you can merge your changes back to the main branch:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge your-feature-branch
      ```

   5. (Optional) Delete the branch after merging:
      After merging, you can delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean:
      ```bash
      git branch -d your-feature-branch
      ``` -->

**_By following these guidelines, you help maintain a clean and manageable project history._**
