This project was developed as part of my data analyst portfolio to demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using a real-world public health dataset. The case study focuses on the impact and spread of Monkeypox across regions, aiming to extract actionable insights from time-series and geographical patterns.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and transforming raw data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Overview and statistical description of Monkeypox cases by country and region.
- **Data Visualization**: Time-series plots, Bar charts, Line plots, Annotated visualizations, and Tables to visualize trends and distributions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use the Program

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RyanGA09/DataAnalyst-ImpactAnalysisOfMonkeypoxCaseStudy.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Required Packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Filter Data**

   Before working on the notebooks, filter the datasets using the provided Python script. You can execute the script by running:

   ```bash
   python filter_monkeypox_data.py
   ```

   This will process the raw data and generate the necessary filtered datasets for further analysis.

6. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   - To perform business understanding, gather data, and data cleaning, open the notebook located in the analysis_processing directory, which focuses on data processing tasks:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_processing/{start_year}_{start_month}_to_{end_year}_{end_month}/Notebook.ipynb
     ```

   - To conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization, open the notebook in the visualization subdirectory, which is focused on further analysis and visual representation of the data:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/visualization/Notebook_visualization_{start_year}_{start_month}_to_{end_year}_{end_month}.ipynb
     ```

7. **Run the Cells**:

   - In the analysis_processing notebooks, execute each cell sequentially to perform data cleaning, data preparation, and business understanding steps.
   - In the visualization notebooks, run each cell to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create data visualizations based on the processed data.

## üìä Dataset Information

### üîó Data Source

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data/raw/original` directory or can be downloaded from the [Monkeypox Data Source](https://ourworldindata.org/mpox).

### üì• Downloading and Placing the Data

1. Download Data: If you choose to download the data, you can obtain it from the [Monkeypox Data Source](https://ourworldindata.org/mpox).
2. Placing the Data: After downloading, ensure that the data file is placed in the `data/raw/original/` directory. This is where the original, unprocessed data should be stored before any filtering or processing takes place.

### Data Filtering Process

Once the original data file is stored in the `data/raw/original` directory, it will be processed and filtered as per the requirements of the analysis. The filtered data will be saved in the `data/raw/filtered` directory. The filtering process includes:

- Removing irrelevant or incomplete data
- Selecting relevant subsets of data for further analysis
- Optimizing the data format and quality to meet the needs of the project

### üîé Data Processing and Analysis

After the filtered data is prepared in the `data/filtered` directory, it will undergo further processing and analysis. The processed data, which is used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization, will be stored in the `data/processed` directory. This stage includes:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights
- Cleaning the data further, if needed, for visualization and statistical analysis
- Generating data visualizations to better understand the trends and relationships in the dataset
